Working with Simon helped us look at our data in a new way. He quickly grasped our issue and found an elegant methodology and a practical implementation that we can keep building on. Simon also explained his approach and tooling well. It built on tested technologies and each step was clearly explained which was essential in allowing us to implement the tooling and expand on it ourselves. It will now form a central part in our ongoing work.
