I am fortunate to have been trained and mentored by Simon at both Annalect and ITV over the past few years. Simon has not only taught me the theoretical side of statistics and data science but also the practical application; such as writing up a project briefs,  through to what kind of statistical model I could use.  I have found Simonâ€™s training invaluable, and frequently look back at my notes or previous jupyter notebooks from Simons sessions when kicking off a project.
