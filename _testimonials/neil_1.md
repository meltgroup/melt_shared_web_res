Simon has a tremendous breadth of knowledge, which allows solutions to be found for a wide range of problems. The training and mentoring sessions have really allowed me to extend my skillset which has enabled me to analyse and interpret data using a much wider range of approaches than I previously could. The training sessions provided me with a greater appreciation of testing methodologies and alerted me to some common misconceptions and misinterpretations.
