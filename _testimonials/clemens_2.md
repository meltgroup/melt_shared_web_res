In the regular conversations I had with Simon, I was able to discuss things I wanted to learn more about in a more technical sense, like for example data visualisation and D3.js, but also more soft skills like presenting results to a non-technical audience, or how to approach certain meetings. One of the most valuable ways he helped me in my day-to-day job was discussing a project, the approach I was taking, and the results of analyses. To have an experienced person looking over your shoulders, providing pointers, and highlighting common pitfalls is invaluable, especially when you are starting out.
