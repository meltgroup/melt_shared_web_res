The one-on-one mentoring sessions were invaluable in providing bespoke solutions to genuine work questions, and to provide approaches that I could follow for future projects. The sessions have enabled me to utilise Jupyter Notebooks to carry out advanced analysis, whilst improving my SQL and Python skills. It has also opened upon a whole range of different data visualisations to employ to better demonstrate the outcomes of my analysis.
