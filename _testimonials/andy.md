Simon was excellent throughout: he grasped the brief immediately, quickly converted hypothetical discussions into an achievable plan of work. Simon far exceeded what we hoped might be possible within the time and budget available. All of this was delivered with great warmth and with ideas expressed in terms that everyone could grasp. I couldnâ€™t recommend Simon any more highly.
