"We don't always have a smoking gun. Instead, we are like lawyers, presenting a case for or against a claim." This piece of advice has changed the way I work. It has also helped with a bit of imposter syndrome where I have often assumed there was some magic way of answering a question, that I wasn'tÂ smart enough to know about. When in fact there probably wasn't, and there are often some more simple, sensible analysis to be done instead, that can be just as powerful.
