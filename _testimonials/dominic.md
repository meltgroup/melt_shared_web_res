Our work with Simon has accelerated our business into a space I couldn’t imagine a year ago. And working with Simon is such a pleasure. Not only is he able to bring structure and meaning to the most complex data he does so from a deeply commercial and pragmatic place. He dials down ‘the esoteric’ because he knows that humans have to use his models and tools. And perhaps most importantly for me he has a great sense of humour.
