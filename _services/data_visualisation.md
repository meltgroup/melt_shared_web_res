#### What is data visualisation?

Data visualisation is the graphical representation of data and information in general. It can take many forms from the familiar bar chart to elaborate, interactive diagrams that have been designed specifically for the data set in question. 

#### Why would you need it?

There are several reasons you might want to use our data visualisation service:

1. A good data visualisation can bring out patterns which were otherwise very difficult to see, especially if you have a lot of data. These patterns might be hidden trends, valuable outliers, important sub groups or unnoticed flaws in a system. 
2. A good data visualisation can be come a talking point within a business; it can create excitement around a topic; it allows people to discuss abstract problems while pointing to something clear and tangible. 
3. Data visualisation can become part of a useful tool for monitoring outcomes or spotting opportunities.

#### How does it work?

The key to a successful data visualisation is what goes on behind the scenes: the statistical expertise that surface the interesting and useful features of the data; the programming work that makes it interactive, the design knowledge that draws the eye to the patterns in the data. Coppelia has all these skills in one place. We can build one-off show-piece visualisations or  browser based tools designed to be permanently in use.

#### Where have we used it?

Among other things, we have used data visualisation to uncover hidden patterns in TV viewing,  identify influencers in social networks, map the reputation of brands, extract taste from free text, and identify geographical areas that are most in need of help from charities.
