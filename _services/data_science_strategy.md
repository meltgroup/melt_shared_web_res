#### What is our AI strategy service?

Have your results so far using AI, and in particular LLMs, been disappointing? Do you fear you lack a clear plan for building AI into your business? Are you uncertain about whether you even have the right use cases? We have over 20 years of experience in artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and statistical analysis. Whether you already have a data science capacity and are moving into LLMS or are just starting out, we can help you with all aspects of designing your strategy, including:

1. Recruiting the right people with the right skills.
2. Identifying AI projects that are likely to succeed and testing their feasibility.
3. Creating a roadmap of AI and data science projects that will allow you to build increasingly sophisticated projects on top of a solid base.
4. Running large, multi-faceted AI and data science projects in an agile manner.
5. Establishing the right set of tools for your team
6. Building [training](/services/training) and [mentoring](/services/mentoring) programmes for your data scientists and AI technicians


#### How does it work?

Typically we begin with a *AI review* where we explore the potential uses of artificial intelligence within your business. The deliverable is a report or presentation providing:

1. A list of the areas where artificial intelligence could be usefully deployed within your business, together with a top level description of how various models and algorithms work and what their value might be.
2. A detailed account of the four most promising and most immediately achievable uses of artificial intelligence, including a description of the steps needed to get there, the required tools, techniques and skills.
3. A project roadmap that interweaves mentoring/training and the projects, ordered so that the projects start simply and increase in complexity as the skills build up.

From here we can help you with the delivery of the roadmap, whether through [Data Science Training](/services/training) and [Data Science Mentoring](/services/mentoring) or through other project based services such as [Information Extraction](/services/information_extraction) or [Next Gen Customer Segmentation](/services/customer_segmentation)
