#### What is Market Sizing?

Market sizing is the process of estimating the potential market for a product or service. It is a critical step in the strategic planning process, as it helps companies understand the size of the opportunity and the potential for growth. Market sizing can be used to inform a wide range of business decisions, including product development, marketing strategy, and investment planning.


#### How does it work?

We combine a range of data sources and methodologies to estimate the size of the market. This can include primary research, such as surveys and interviews, as well as secondary research, such as industry reports and market data. We also use a range of quantitative and qualitative techniques to estimate the size of the market, including top-down and bottom-up approaches.
