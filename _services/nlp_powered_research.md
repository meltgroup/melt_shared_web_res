#### What is NLP?

NLP means Natural Language processing - a set of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to get at the content of sentences spoken by human beings. Typical NLP tasks are:

1. Find all the people, places and things spoken about in a document or webpage.
2. Identify the linguistic style, reading age or even the mood  or of the person who is speaking.
3. Identify the topic that is being talked about.

#### What are Large Language Models?

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems that are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They use deep learning techniques to learn patterns and representations in the data, allowing them to comprehend context, grammar, and semantics, and produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses. 

#### How does it change how we do research?

AI-Powered Research involves asking a small but representative sample of your audience(s) a set of clear, pointed open text questions around the topic you’re interested in. NLP and LLMs are then applied to the results to turn these text responses into structured data and then meaningful insights. We then use, among other things, [Data Visualisation](/services/data_visualisation) to bring the results to life.

#### Where have we used it?

Partnering with [Wonder&Wonder](/melt_members/mark_potts), Coppelia has used NLP-powered research to inform product design and understand the needs of subscription TV viewers. Coppelia has also used this technique to help [Here I am](https://www.hereiamstudio.com) analyse the data gathered by its ethical research platform [Fatima](https://www.hereiamstudio.com/fatima).
