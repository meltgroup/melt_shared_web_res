#### What is NLP?

NLP means Natural Language processing - a set of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to get at the content of sentences spoken by human beings. Typical NLP tasks are:

1. Find all the people, places and things spoken about in a document or webpage.
2. Identify the linguistic style, reading age or even the mood  or of the person who is speaking.
3. Identify the topic that is being talked about.

#### How does it change how we do research?

NLP is often applied to social media messages in the hope that it will yield valuable insights. The results are often poor because people don't always talk about what you want them to talk about. 

At the same time there is a misconception that NLP requires an enormous amount of data. This is not true. 

NLP-Powered Research involves asking a small but representative sample of the population open but pointed questions about topics the researcher wants to hear discussed. NLP is then applied to the results to turn them into something which can be analysed. We then use, among other things, [Data Visualisation](/services/data_visualisation) to bring the results to life.

#### Where have we used it?

Partnering with [Wonder&Wonder](/melt_members/mark_potts), Coppelia has used NLP-powered research to inform product design and understand the needs of subscription TV viewers. Coppelia has also used this technique to help [Here I am](https://www.hereiamstudio.com) analyse the data gathered by its ethical research platform [Fatima](https://www.hereiamstudio.com/fatima).
