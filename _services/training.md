#### What kind of training do we offer?

Our mentoring and training programmes are custom built to suit the needs of your business. We offer some standard packages but can combine them in any way that suits you and can create new ones if you have a requirement that is not covered here.

The following are offered as one or two day workshops, online or in person.

#### Training or mentoring or both?

If you have a small team of data scientists with specialised roles then the best option is usually to run [mentoring](/services/mentoring) for each of them. For large teams, or teams where some members are only partially involved in data science, then it can be more cost effective to mentor the more advanced members of the team and run group sessions for the whole on team on wider topics of general interest.

Note, many of our clients find it particularly effective to engage us on other project based services (e.g. [Next-Gen Customer Segmentation](/services/customer_segmentation)), while at the same running our mentoring and training programmes. This ensures that the technology and methods used in the project are integrated with the training and your team are in a good position to take over and further develop the work that we have done for you.
