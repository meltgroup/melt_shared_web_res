#### What is data science mentoring?

Are your data scientists highly-qualified, motivated and keen to learn, yet frustrated when it comes to applying their skills? 

Working out how to apply statistical and data science skills to problems in the real world is one of the hardest things to learn. Fortunately we have plenty of experience here and can work with your data scientists in one-to-one sessions to unblock projects, explore and test innovative new solutions and extend their technical tool set. We offer a range of plans covering all levels of experience.

#### How does it work?

We have three standard mentoring packages, but we are also very happy to a produce a package that is tailored to your needs.

#### What is a personalised development plan?

The **personalised development plan** includes:

- Help with setting (and achieving) short to medium term technical goals (I want to learn R or D3, I want to have a good working knowledge of machine learning)
- Long term career guidance for data scientists, e.g. working out where they would like to specialise, looking at how to grow a reputation, how to build up a portfolio through work and outside work (blogging, related technical hobbies).
- Creating a study programme out of online course (coursera, udacity etc)
- Working on skills which are complementary to technical skills (how to communicate technical matters clearly, good visual design etc)

#### What is supervised project work?

By **supervised project work** we mean: based on the short to medium term technical goals in the development plan and either current work projects or external hobby projects, identifying a discrete piece of work that we can then help the analyst work through to completion. An example might be as follows:

Since you would like to learn d3 and since your company would benefit from being able to create attractive visualisations of networks, let’s work on a project where you:

-   Complete the introductory course to d3 on udacity
-   Build a simple network graph example using basic data
-   Create a prototype using company data
-   Learn how to make it look visually appealing using css and design principles

The development plan and the supervised project work are managed by setting actions at the end of each mentoring session and reviewing them at the beginning of the following session.
