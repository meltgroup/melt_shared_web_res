Niazy is a data scientist and researcher with an MSc in advanced statistical modelling and qualitative methods. Her recent work at 38 Degrees focused on building and embedding data tools to inform digital campaigning, organisational health, and strategy. She’s led projects including forecasting retention rates to set benchmarks; using natural language processing and behavioural data to build audience segments; developing tools to identify potential high-value subscribers, and designing board-level performance metrics that combine external and proprietary data. She’s also worked with the University of Manchester, Survation, Forward Action, FocalData, Populares, and NHS Change.

Niazy’s background as a languages teacher means she’s great at leading interactive workshops with teams and senior leaders. She brings a pragmatic, collaborative approach that helps organisations uncover strategic value from their data and embed the results.
