Neil Charles launched Sequence Analytics in 2022, after over twenty years in marketing measurement and analysis. Previously, Neil headed a data science and technology team at MediaCom and he has experience across a range of businesses, having worked at the Nectar loyalty card, EMI Music, Mindshare and for the statistics consultancy Gain Theory.

Sequence Analytics brings together customer segmentation, web metrics and long-term effectiveness measurement, to produce a truly joined-up view of marketing that combines ROI with profiles of which types of customer are responding.
It's return on investment measurement not just with a 'how much?' but also with a 'who?' that allows you to build better targeted, more effective campaigns.
